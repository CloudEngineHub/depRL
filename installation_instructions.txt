The easiest way to install this is to create a new virtual environment and run:
python -m pip install deprl-0.1.0b2-py3-none-any.whl

Then afterwards, clone sconegym-dev with the natural_walking_paper branch and then:
python -m pip install -e ./sconegym-dev

Done! To start playing around, you can use the built-in command:
python -m deprl.play --path learned_policy

where 'learned_policy' is a folder that contains a trained policy.

Or you take a look at the example file:
python example/sconegym_example.py

Make sure the learned_policy folder is in a path that the example file can find.

If you want to install from source to have more control, you can use the poetry framework, which I really like, but is a bit more work to setup.


Or, if you want to go the easy way, try:
git clone git@github.com:P-Schumacher/deprl_internal.git
cd deprl_internal
python -m pip install -r pip_requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
cd ..

and then

git clone git@github.com:tgeijten/sconegym-dev.git
cd sconegym-dev
git checkout -B natural_walking_paper
python -m pip install -e sconegym-dev
